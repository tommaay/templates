3. For e
   - Use clear and concise language

   - Maintain consistency throughout the document
   - Address all points mentioned in each section

4. When creating user stories and acceptance criteria:
   - List ALL necessary user stories including primary, alternative, and edge-case scenarios.
   - Assign a unique requirement ID (e.g., US-001) to each user story for direct traceability
   - Include at least one user story specifically for secure access or authentication if the application requires user identification or access restrictions

</user_story>

5. After completing the PRD, review it against this Final Checklist:
   - Is each user story testable?
   - Are acceptance criteria clear and specific?
   - Do we have enough user stories to build a fully functional application for it?
   - Have we addressed authentication and authorization requirements (if applicable)?

6. Format your PRD:
   - Maintain consistent formatting and numbering.
   - Don't format text in markdown bold "\*\*", we don't need this.
   - List ALL User Stories in the output!
   - Format the PRD in valid Markdown, with no extraneous disclaimers.
